-----------------------------
cd - change working directory 
-----------------------------
cd
You can change your current directory with the cd command (Change Directory).

cd ~
The cd is also a shortcut to get back into your home directory. Just typing cd without a target
directory, will put you in your home directory. Typing cd ~ has the same effect.

cd ..
To go to the parent directory (the one just above your current directory in the directory
tree), type cd .. .


-------------------------------------
ls - disply list of files or directory 
-------------------------------------

ls
You can list the contents of a directory with ls.

ls -a
A frequently used option with ls is -a to show all files

ls -l -11
Typing just ls gives you a list of files in the directory

ls -lh
t shows the numbers (file sizes) in a more human readable format

--------------
mkdir
--------------
to create your own directories with mkdir. You have to give at least one parameter to mkdir, the name of the new directory to be created.

mkdir -p
When given the option -p, then mkdir will create parent directories as needed.


rmdir
you can use rmdir to remove the directory

rmdir -p
you can also use rmdir to recursively remove directories.


----------------------------------
Excersies working with directories
----------------------------------
Display your current directory.
pwd

Change to the /etc directory.
cd /etc

Now change to your home directory using only three key presses.
cd (and the enter key)

Change to the /boot/grub directory using only eleven key presses.
cd /boot/grub (use the tab key)

Go to the parent directory of the current directory.
cd .. (with space between cd and ..)

Go to the root directory.
cd /

List the contents of the root directory.
ls

List a long listing of the root directory.
ls -l

Stay where you are, and list the contents of /etc.
ls /etc

Stay where you are, and list the contents of /bin and /sbin.
ls /bin /sbin

Stay where you are, and list the contents of ~.
ls ~

List all the files (including hidden files) in your home directory.
ls -al ~

List the files in a human readable format.



-----------------
working with files
------------------
file
file utility determines the file type. Linux does not use extensions to determine the file
type. The command line does not care whether a file ends in .txt or .pdf

touch
One easy way to create an empty file is with touch


rm
When you use rm to remove a file, the file is gone. Therefore, be careful when removing files!


rm -i
To prevent yourself from accidentally removing a file, you can type rm -i


rm -rf
be very careful with rm -rf (the f means force and the r means recursive) You can literally erase your entire file system by accident. 


cp
To copy a file, use cp with a source and a target argument.
sameFolder	cp file42 file42
DifferentFolder	cp SinkoDeMayo FolderName
multipFolder    cp file42 file42 FolfrtName	

cp -r
To copy complete directories, use cp -r (the -r option forces recursive copying of all files
in all subdirectories).


cp -i
To prevent cp from overwriting existing files, use the -i (for interactive) option.


mv
Use mv to rename a file or to move the file to another directory.


mv -i
shows that mv -i will ask permission to overwrite an existing file


----------------------------------
Excersies working with files
----------------------------------
List the files in the / directory
Create a directory name App
Create the files today.txt and yesterday.txt
Rename today.txt and yesterday.txt to Saturday.txt and Sunday.txt
Create a directory called /backupApp and copy all files from App into it
Remove the App directory and all its content




-----------
file links
-----------
creating hard links
	When we create a hard link to a file with ln, an extra entry is added in the directory.
	ln fileName whereToLink
symbolic links
	Symbolic links (sometimes called soft links) create a name to name mapping.	
	ln -s whereToLink
removing links rm linkName


----------------------------------
Excersies working with links
----------------------------------
Create two files named winter.txt and summer.txt
Create a hard link to winter.txt named hlwinter.txt
Create a symbolic link to summer.txt called slsummer.txt




--------------------------
working with file contents
--------------------------

head
You can use head to display the first ten lines of a file.

head -Number of line
The head command can also display the first n lines of a file.


tail
the tail command will display the last ten lines of a file.

tail -Number of line
The tail command can also display the first n lines of a file.


cat
you can use cat to display a file on the screen

cat
You can use cat to add flat text files. cat > FileName


more
The more command is useful for displaying files that take up more than one screen


----------------------------------
Excersies working with files content
----------------------------------

Display the first 12 lines of /etc/group
Display the last line of /etc/passwd



--------------
user & groups management 
---------------

Type of users in liunx 
	root
	admin users
        normal users 
        system users - user created when installing software for example Jenkins user
        
The local user database on Linux (and on most Unixes) is /etc/passwd.
	useradd  You can add users with the useradd command
	userdel You can delete the user yanina with userdel. The -r will also remove thehome directory.
	usermod to add user to group usermod -a -G groupName userName
	passwd Passwords of users can be set with the passwd command
	su to swithc users
	
	groupadd Groups can be created with the groupadd command
	groups list of group
	groupmod You can change the group name with the groupmod command
	groupdel You can permanently remove a group with the groupdel command.
	

Permission attributes:
  Read    - r      = 4   grant read access for a user  
  Write   - w      = 2   grant write/modify  access for a user
  Execute - x      = 1   grant access to run the file as a command 
  
chmod : It will change the file or directory access permissions.
       chmod +rwx test 
       chmod 777 test 
       
chown : It will change the ownership of the file or dir.
	sudo chown simon:simon test 
	
----------------------------------
Excersies working with users
----------------------------------
Create a user account named serena
Set the password for serena to hunter2
Verify that user have correct entries in /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow and /etc/group
change the password of serena to serena 
Create the groups tennis, football and sports
add serena to the tennis group
create folder OnlineTennis and change the owner to serena
change the permession of OnlineTennis to give wrx 




--------------------
filesystem hierarchy
-------------------
All Linux systems have a directory structure that starts at the root directory. The root
directory is represented by a forward slash, like this: /. Everything that exists on your Linux system can be found below this root directory cd /


Binaries are files that contain compiled source code (or machine code).
	The /bin directory contains binaries for use by all users
	The /sbin contains binaries to configure the operating system.

configuration directories
	The /boot directory contains all files needed to boot the computer
	All of the machine-specific configuration files should be located in /etc
		/etc/init.d/ directory that contains scripts to start and stop daemons.
		/etc/sysconfig/ system configuration
	

data directories
	The /home Users can store personal or project data under
	The /srv for data that is served by your system
	The /media The /media directory serves as a mount point for removable media devices such as CD, USB etc
	The /mnt The /mnt directory should be empty and should only be used for temporary mount points
	
memory directories
	The /dev directory is populated with files as the kernel is recognising hardware
	The /proc It is actually a view of the kernel,
	The /sys irectory contains kernel information about hardware
		
System Resources
	The /usr hierarchy should contain shareable, read only data. Some people choose to mount/usr as read only.
	The /var store Files that are unpredictable in size, such as log, cache and spool files exmaple /var/log /var/cache
